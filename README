Websh - An interactive shell for the World Wide Web
====================================================

Websh is an interactive HTTP client based on libCurl. It supports many HTTP 
methods, including GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, and DELETE.

What is the purpose of such a tool, you may ask? Why couldn't I simply use a
webbrowser? Currently, I envision two uses for this program.

1) Interacting with database servers that speak the HTTP protocol. CouchDB and
Kyoto Tycoon are good examples.

2) Interacting with websites' HTTP apis. 

Dependencies:
libcurl

Websh includes Linenoise, a BSD-licensed readline replacement originally

Websh is inspired by Alexis Seller's NodeJS module http-console.
